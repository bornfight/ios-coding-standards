Procedure for adding new rules to the repository:
1. Check if the error is recurring or critical (important for everybody)
2. Check if the error is not covered by some of the previous rules
2. Write a rule to correct the mistake
3. Write a short code snippet (https://help.github.com/articles/creating-and-highlighting-code-blocks/)
4. Keep it generic and avoid copy/pasting from private projects
5. Create a pull request and assign it to **fajdof** or **tamaramilisa**
6. Enjoy as your rule takes its rightful place in the docs :)
